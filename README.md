ðŸ‘‹ WELCOME TO CROWDAIR!ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“ˆ Crowdair is a plateform design to let users trade their actions on specific events. 
ðŸ’° The goal is to make as much coins a possible to get the first position of the podium. 

Every event includes news to help you make the best choice before selling or buying actions.
Notice that events have an ending time ðŸ“…, so you need to hurry up.

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
